Droopy is a profiler of the last chance to profile application servers.
It essentially consists in two parts:
  - A client side that runs `strace' and analyzes the trace thus collected
    and can upload them to ElasticSearch.
  - A viewer that provides a UI to dig in the data stored in ElasticSearch.

Droopy was designed to work on PHP applications running under Apache, but it
also works on any other application server that uses "one process per
connection" or "one thread per connection" model.  Many popular web application
frameworks (e.g. Ruby on Rails, Django, and all PHP frameworks) employ this
model.  As long as the application is not event driven, Droopy will be able to
collate the system calls and match it to the request.

It's a "profiler of the last chance" because it really is a poor man's
solution to doing profiling and it has a non-negligible overhead.  It's
recommended to build applications that provide the profiling information
and not rely on this.  But this tool is useful for legacy applications
or applications that cannot be easily modified to add profiling support.
