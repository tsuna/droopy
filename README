Droopy is a profiler of the last chance to profile application servers.
It essentially consists in two parts:
  - A client side that runs `strace' and analyzes the trace thus collected.
  - A server side that receives the analyzed traces and stores them in HBase
    for future analyses.

Droopy was designed to work on PHP applications running under Apache, but
it also works on any other application server that uses the pathetic "one
process per connection" or "one thread per connection" model (which really
is something from the 90s and shouldn't exist anymore, but still does).

It's a "profiler of the last chance" because it really is a poor man's
solution to doing profiling and it has a non-negligible overhead.  It's
recommended to build applications that provide the profiling information
and not rely on this.  But this tool is useful for legacy applications
or applications that cannot be easily modified to add profiling support.
