Droopy is a profiler of the last chance to profile application servers.
It essentially consists in two parts:
  - A client side that runs `strace' and analyzes the trace thus collected.
  - A server side that receives the analyzed traces and stores them in HBase
    for future analyses.

Droopy was designed to work on PHP applications running under Apache, but
it also works on any other application server that uses the pathetic "one
process per connection" or "one thread per connection" model (which really
is something from the 90s and shouldn't exist anymore, but still does).
